# Monte Carlo Method
**Monte Carlo method is a class of computational algorithms that use repeated random samples of states, actions, and rewards from actual or simulated interaction with an environment to obtain numerical results or we can say Monte Carlo methods are ways of solving the reinforcement learning problem based on averaging sample returns.**
* Model-free (means we do not have complete knowledge of the environment) prediction and control method for finite MDP problem.
* Estimate value functions $V(x_n)$ and optimize policies $\pi$ in unknown MDP.
